## Description
This project downloaded four data sets including the NYC zip code, 311 complaints, NYC trees, and rent data from Zillow to achieve data analysis and visualization. The first part includes downloading necessary data, cleaning unnecessary columns, changing format and variable names, and finally normalizing SRID format to make it consistent across all data sets. The second part creates a schema file and adds all data to the PostgreSQL database. In parts 3 and 4, the project completed the necessary analysis according to the guidelines. Additionally, the project added an animation graph in part 4 Question 2 as well as hints for all functions.
